Test scenario 1 : 
  
  
  Use H2 "in memory" with "DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1" to keep the DB between different connections
  
  In the same JVM :
  - Launch JPA create tables
  - Launch Telosys create DB model 
  
  Create a new Telosys project dedicated to this job
  
  
Test scenario 2 :

  Use HSQLDB (simpler : no server notion, only JDBC connections ) 

  Define DB in persistence.sql
